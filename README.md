# RAPID-Pool-A-better-way-to-Share-Rides
Uber rides have become a convenient means of transport but irrespective of the increased demand at certain locations and time periods, there are issues such as unavailability of rides, or longer waiting periods for the customer. To resolve this issue, we provide a Data Analytics solution using Apache Spark on live streamed data to locate users heading to the same vicinity and suggest the customer to pool their rides. We use Spark as we are streaming live data and analyzing which locations are likely to face shortage of rides. This will reduce the waiting time and solve the issue of unavailability as well as provide incentives, such as reduced ride costs.
